# The LedPhotoDistributedSerial

This project was created to demonstrate the work of the photo sensor and the led.

**The board consists of:**
+ light sensor;
+ one LEDs.

The indicators show the direction in which the breadboard should be turned. The LED that is closer to the light source blinks. When the optimal direction is found, both LEDs light up. This works for you optimized with python script.

**Demonstration of work:**
