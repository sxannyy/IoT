# The traffic lights

This project was created to demonstrate the operation of the traffic lights.

**Automatic control:** green (10 sec) - flashing green (2 sec) - yellow (1 sec) - red (7 sec) - yellow (1 sec) - green (10 sec).

**Manual control is carried out via a command from a PC:**
+ request for translation;
+ mode in which the traffic light is green or red;
+ transition from green/red through yellow.
